#### Details

The R package requires R (version > 3.5.0). Pre-build binaries for the current official release of the package are available from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network), but if the user desires to compile the package for himself, then the typical R compiler tools will have to be installed. Instructions can be found on the R Project’s website at https://www.r-project.org/nosvn/pandoc/devtools.html.

The latest development version of the package can be found on Github. 

To install the development version of hlt, install the devtools package (Wickham et al., 2021) and run the following command:

```r
devtools::install_github(“mkleinsa/hlt”)
library(hlt)
```

See the README of the hlt package on the Github repository page for additional details about package installation. To install the development version of the package, compilation of the C++ code is required at install, so the user’s development toolchain must at least include a C++ compiler.
